# Nuxt Best Practices

These notes improve execution quality for AI agents in this repository.
They complement Nuxt docs; they do not replace official documentation.

## Source baseline
- Nuxt docs: `docs/3.guide/2.best-practices/*`, `docs/1.getting-started/10.data-fetching.md`, `docs/3.guide/4.modules/6.best-practices.md`
- Nuxt source: `packages/nuxt/src/app/composables/{asyncData,fetch,once}.ts`, `packages/nuxt/src/app/nuxt.ts`

## How to use this file
1. Start with the smallest high-priority pack that matches the actual surface or symptom.
2. Apply rule IDs directly; do not paraphrase away Nuxt-specific caveats.
3. Treat the first six packs as disambiguation overlays before broader infra packs.
4. Keep scope narrow: open only the sections needed for the current change.
5. Nuxt guidance is default; module guidance overrides it only inside explicit module scope.

## Rule Packs

<!-- automd:file src="./rules/abstraction-disambiguation.md" -->

## Abstraction Disambiguation

### Rule ID: `disambiguation-framework-primitives-first`
### Rule: Prefer framework-owned primitives before generic Vue or raw HTML
### When to apply
Any fix where generic Vue code, hand-rolled HTML, or custom event wiring looks plausible.

### Wrong pattern
Solving a Nuxt problem with ad hoc watchers, raw fetches, or custom markup when Nuxt, Nuxt Content, or Nuxt UI already owns the surface.

### Recommended pattern
Identify the framework-owned abstraction first, then use generic Vue primitives only when the framework does not provide a suitable surface.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Visually correct custom code can still be the wrong answer if it bypasses a Nuxt-native abstraction that hidden evals or framework conventions expect.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: the exact surface being edited and whether Nuxt, Nuxt Content, or Nuxt UI already provides a first-class primitive.
- [ ] Minimal verification: the final solution uses the framework abstraction when one exists.
- [ ] Stop condition: the task explicitly requires behavior outside the owned abstraction.

### Rule ID: `disambiguation-nearby-concepts-before-editing`
### Rule: Resolve nearby concept pairs before changing code
### When to apply
Tasks that could map to two similar Nuxt concepts.

### Wrong pattern
Editing the first plausible API without deciding the actual concept pair first.

### Recommended pattern
Explicitly decide the concept pair before editing, such as `definePageMeta` vs `useHead`, data collection vs page collection, `NuxtLink` vs raw `<a>`, or `useCookie` vs `document.cookie`.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Many strong agents fail Nuxt tasks by choosing the wrong nearby abstraction rather than by writing broken code.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: prompt symptoms, file location, and framework-owned surface.
- [ ] Minimal verification: the chosen abstraction matches the actual responsibility of the change.
- [ ] Stop condition: both concepts are intentionally involved and clearly separated.

### Rule ID: `disambiguation-do-not-stop-at-visually-correct`
### Rule: Do not accept a visually correct result as sufficient
### When to apply
UI, docs, or content tasks where a hand-built implementation can look correct.

### Wrong pattern
Declaring success because the output looks fine while bypassing Nuxt UI, Content, or SSR-aware primitives.

### Recommended pattern
Check whether the implementation is framework-correct, not only visually correct.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Nuxt evals often reject custom HTML solutions even when they render acceptably, because the intended abstraction was a framework primitive.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: component usage, slot API, and data source wiring.
- [ ] Minimal verification: the implementation matches the expected framework primitive and API shape.
- [ ] Stop condition: the prompt explicitly asks for custom markup or behavior the primitive cannot support.

<!-- automd:file src="./rules/page-meta-head-layout.md" -->

## Page Meta, Head, and Layout

### Rule ID: `page-define-page-meta-for-page-behavior`
### Rule: Use `definePageMeta` for page behavior, not document metadata
### When to apply
Changing layout, middleware, route rules, page transitions, keepalive, or other page-level behavior.

### Wrong pattern
Using `useHead` or ad hoc component wiring for concerns that belong in page metadata.

### Recommended pattern
Use `definePageMeta` in page files for page behavior and routing-related options.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
`definePageMeta` is about how a page behaves inside the app, not what goes into the document head.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: whether the change lives in a page file and affects app behavior rather than head tags.
- [ ] Minimal verification: page behavior is expressed through page metadata instead of custom glue.
- [ ] Stop condition: the change is not page-scoped.

### Rule ID: `page-use-head-for-document-metadata`
### Rule: Use `useHead` or `useSeoMeta` for title and meta tags
### When to apply
Changing page title, meta description, canonical URLs, social metadata, or structured head elements.

### Wrong pattern
Trying to set document metadata with `definePageMeta` or template markup.

### Recommended pattern
Use `useHead` for general document head state and `useSeoMeta` for SEO-focused metadata.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Head metadata and page metadata are adjacent concepts but are not interchangeable.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: the exact metadata surface being changed.
- [ ] Minimal verification: head data is emitted through Nuxt head composables.
- [ ] Stop condition: the task is about route behavior, layout, or middleware instead.

### Rule ID: `page-layout-structure-belongs-in-layouts`
### Rule: Put shared page chrome and structure in layouts or framework shells
### When to apply
Repeated headers, footers, navigation shells, or shared page structure across routes.

### Wrong pattern
Copying shell markup into pages or mixing layout concerns into unrelated components.

### Recommended pattern
Use layout files or framework-owned shell primitives for shared structure.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Layout confusion often travels with `definePageMeta` vs `useHead` confusion, so resolve both surfaces together.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: whether the structure is shared across pages and whether a layout already exists.
- [ ] Minimal verification: shared shell concerns live in the layout layer, not duplicated page markup.
- [ ] Stop condition: the structure is intentionally page-specific.

<!-- automd:file src="./rules/error-surfaces-recovery.md" -->

## Error Surfaces and Recovery

### Rule ID: `error-check-global-and-local-surfaces`
### Rule: Check both global and local error surfaces
### When to apply
Handling runtime errors, route failures, or fallback UI in Nuxt.

### Wrong pattern
Fixing only `app/error.vue` or only a local `NuxtErrorBoundary` when the flow requires both.

### Recommended pattern
Identify whether the issue needs a global error surface, a local boundary, or both, then implement both surfaces explicitly when required.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Nuxt error handling is often multi-surface; solving only half the pattern is a recurring failure mode in strong models.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: where the error originates and whether recovery is route-wide or local to a subtree.
- [ ] Minimal verification: the intended error surface actually receives and renders the failure.
- [ ] Stop condition: the issue is intentionally scoped to one surface only.

### Rule ID: `error-use-nuxt-recovery-utilities`
### Rule: Use Nuxt recovery helpers instead of ad hoc reset logic
### When to apply
Recovering from an error state or clearing error UI.

### Wrong pattern
Resetting local refs or forcing navigation without using Nuxt recovery utilities.

### Recommended pattern
Use Nuxt error helpers such as `clearError`, `showError`, and framework-supported retry paths.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Custom reset logic can leave the app in an inconsistent state if it bypasses Nuxt's error lifecycle.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: current error state flow and whether Nuxt helpers are already present.
- [ ] Minimal verification: recovery clears the error surface and restores intended navigation or rendering behavior.
- [ ] Stop condition: the task explicitly requires a non-standard recovery path.

<!-- /automd -->

<!-- automd:file src="./rules/verification-finish.md" -->

## Verification and Finish

### Rule ID: `verify-check-the-intended-surface`
### Rule: Verify the intended framework surface, not only the visible result
### When to apply
Before concluding a Nuxt change.

### Wrong pattern
Stopping once the UI looks correct or once one failing line was changed.

### Recommended pattern
Confirm that the final implementation uses the intended Nuxt, Nuxt Content, or Nuxt UI surface.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Framework tasks often fail because the behavior is visibly fixed but implemented through the wrong abstraction.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: the final primitive, composable, or component choice.
- [ ] Minimal verification: the solution matches the framework-owned abstraction expected by the task.
- [ ] Stop condition: the prompt explicitly asks for a framework-agnostic implementation.

### Rule ID: `verify-second-surface-before-finish`
### Rule: Check for a second required surface before finishing
### When to apply
Tasks involving errors, layout plus page behavior, or server/client boundaries.

### Wrong pattern
Editing the first obvious file and concluding the work without checking paired surfaces.

### Recommended pattern
Ask whether the change also needs a global/local or server/client counterpart, then verify both surfaces explicitly.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Nuxt patterns often span more than one file or render surface, especially around errors and privileged data flow.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: related files such as `app/error.vue`, local boundaries, server routes, client callers, layouts, and pages.
- [ ] Minimal verification: both required surfaces are updated or explicitly ruled out.
- [ ] Stop condition: the task is intentionally isolated to one surface.

### Rule ID: `verify-version-sensitive-api-shapes`
### Rule: Re-check version-sensitive API shapes before finalizing
### When to apply
Using components or module APIs that have plausible older alternatives.

### Wrong pattern
Trusting approximate memory for component props, slot names, or composable signatures.

### Recommended pattern
Re-check the installed skill or linked docs when an API shape looks close but uncertain.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Version drift often shows up as “almost right” component or module usage that passes casual review but is wrong for the installed version.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: wrapper links, installed skill guidance, and exact component or composable signature.
- [ ] Minimal verification: current API names and state models match the installed version.
- [ ] Stop condition: the local project intentionally wraps the upstream API with a different contract.

<!-- /automd -->

<!-- automd:file src="./rules/data-fetching-ssr.md" -->

## Data Fetching and SSR

### Rule ID: `data-usefetch-or-asyncdata-for-initial`
### Rule: Use `useFetch`/`useAsyncData` for initial render data
### When to apply
Building SSR pages or route-level data loading.

### Wrong pattern
Using `$fetch` directly in setup for initial render data, causing SSR+CSR duplicate requests.

### Recommended pattern
Use `useFetch` for HTTP-first fetching and `useAsyncData` for custom async logic or multi-request composition.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
`$fetch` is ideal for event-driven interactions; initial view data should normally be payload-backed via `useFetch`/`useAsyncData`.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: setup-time `$fetch` usage and async data composable usage.
- [ ] Minimal verification: initial render data is transferred via Nuxt payload, without extra hydration fetch.
- [ ] Stop condition: call is explicitly client-only and non-SEO-critical.

### Rule ID: `data-stable-keys-and-option-consistency`
### Rule: Keep async-data keys explicit and option-consistent
### When to apply
Sharing `useAsyncData` or `useFetch` state across components/composables.

### Wrong pattern
Relying on autogenerated keys in wrappers or using same key with conflicting `transform`/`pick`/`deep` behavior.

### Recommended pattern
Use explicit stable keys and keep key-sharing options consistent.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Nuxt warns on incompatible shared-key options and can produce confusing state reuse if keys are unstable.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: key construction and repeated composable calls.
- [ ] Minimal verification: no key collisions; shared-key options match.
- [ ] Stop condition: scope truly requires isolated state per call site.

### Rule ID: `data-side-effects-via-callonce`
### Rule: Keep `useAsyncData` handlers side-effect free
### When to apply
Data loaders that also trigger analytics, store mutations, or one-time bootstrapping.

### Wrong pattern
Running side effects inside the `useAsyncData` handler.

### Recommended pattern
Return data only from handler; move side effects to `callOnce` or explicit event handlers.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
`useAsyncData` re-execution paths (`watch`, refresh, navigation) can replay embedded side effects.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: handler body for side effects, store writes, and non-idempotent calls.
- [ ] Minimal verification: handler remains pure relative to its inputs.
- [ ] Stop condition: third-party API requires coupled side effects and cannot be decoupled.

### Rule ID: `data-reactive-url-not-watch-only`
### Rule: Use reactive URL/options, not `watch` alone, for parameterized fetches
### When to apply
Fetching data from reactive route params, filters, or query inputs.

### Wrong pattern
Passing a static URL string and expecting `watch: [id]` to change endpoint automatically.

### Recommended pattern
Use computed URL or reactive fetch options (`query`, `params`) and opt out with `watch: false` only intentionally.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Reactive fetch options are watched by default; computed URL updates are first-class.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: URL construction, watch config, and query/params refs.
- [ ] Minimal verification: endpoint and data refresh when reactive dependencies change.
- [ ] Stop condition: endpoint must remain static while auxiliary state changes.

### Rule ID: `data-minimize-payload-shape`
### Rule: Minimize payload transfer for SSR data
### When to apply
Fetching large objects/arrays where only a subset is needed for initial render.

### Wrong pattern
Transferring full backend payload to client when template uses a few fields.

### Recommended pattern
Use `pick`/`transform` for payload shaping and split non-critical data into lazy client-only fetches when appropriate.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
`pick`/`transform` reduce payload transfer size, not upstream API response size.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: fetched object shape vs template usage.
- [ ] Minimal verification: payload contains only needed fields for first paint.
- [ ] Stop condition: downstream consumers rely on full object in the same render boundary.

### Rule ID: `data-serialization-boundary-awareness`
### Rule: Respect serialization differences between payload and API routes
### When to apply
Returning non-primitive values (Date, Map, Set, custom classes) through SSR data and server API routes.

### Wrong pattern
Assuming all Nuxt data transfer paths serialize complex types identically.

### Recommended pattern
Treat `useAsyncData` payload serialization and server-route JSON serialization as distinct boundaries; normalize API outputs (or custom `toJSON`) when needed.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Nuxt payload transfer uses `devalue`, while server route responses are serialized via JSON behavior, which has stricter type limits.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: returned types across `useAsyncData` handlers and `server/api/*` responses.
- [ ] Minimal verification: client receives expected shape/types on both transport paths.
- [ ] Stop condition: upstream contract mandates non-serializable runtime-only values.

<!-- /automd -->

<!-- automd:file src="./rules/hydration-consistency.md" -->

## Hydration and SSR Consistency

### Rule ID: `hydration-no-browser-apis-in-ssr-path`
### Rule: Keep browser-only APIs out of SSR execution paths
### When to apply
Reading storage, window size, document state, or navigator data in setup/render paths.

### Wrong pattern
Accessing `window`, `document`, or `localStorage` during server render.

### Recommended pattern
Use SSR-safe primitives (`useCookie`, server data, request headers) or gate browser-only logic in `ClientOnly`/`onMounted`.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Hydration mismatch can force full subtree re-render and break event binding assumptions.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: setup code for browser globals and conditional rendering paths.
- [ ] Minimal verification: first SSR HTML and first client render produce matching structure/content.
- [ ] Stop condition: third-party dependency cannot run without browser APIs before mount.

### Rule ID: `hydration-deterministic-first-render`
### Rule: Make first render deterministic across server and client
### When to apply
Rendering dynamic values such as timestamps, randomness, or locale-sensitive formatting.

### Wrong pattern
Using `Math.random()`, `new Date()`, or environment-specific formatting directly in template/setup for first paint.

### Recommended pattern
Seed shared state with `useState`, use `NuxtTime`, or defer non-deterministic values until after mount.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Time/randomness differences between SSR and CSR are a common hydration mismatch cause.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: first-render values derived from time/random/browser environment.
- [ ] Minimal verification: page hydrates without mismatch warnings.
- [ ] Stop condition: feature explicitly requires client-personalized first paint with acceptable fallback.

### Rule ID: `hydration-client-only-libraries-after-mount`
### Rule: Initialize DOM-mutating third-party libraries after hydration
### When to apply
Integrating analytics, tag managers, embeds, or widgets that touch DOM directly.

### Wrong pattern
Running library initialization in universal setup path.

### Recommended pattern
Load/init libraries in `onMounted` or dedicated client plugins and provide SSR-safe fallback markup.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
`import.meta.client` guards code path, but DOM writes before hydration completion can still create mismatch risk.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: library init location and DOM mutation timing.
- [ ] Minimal verification: no hydration warnings and no visible layout flash from re-render.
- [ ] Stop condition: library requires synchronous pre-hydration bootstrap with no fallback option.

<!-- /automd -->

<!-- automd:file src="./rules/architecture-boundaries.md" -->

## Architecture Boundaries

### Rule ID: `arch-secrets-server-only`
### Rule: Keep secrets and request checks server-side
### When to apply
Implementing auth, secret-bearing API calls, or per-request business logic.

### Wrong pattern
Placing secret usage in shared composables imported by client code.

### Recommended pattern
Move sensitive logic to `server/api/*` handlers, server utilities, or server plugins.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Anything in `runtimeConfig.public` is client-visible.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: changed files in `server/`, `composables/`, and `runtimeConfig` usage.
- [ ] Minimal verification: no secret values or token checks in client bundles.
- [ ] Stop condition: a required server-only check cannot be moved out of client code.

### Rule ID: `arch-request-safe-state`
### Rule: Use request-safe state boundaries
### When to apply
Adding reusable cross-page logic with state.

### Wrong pattern
Using mutable module-level singletons for request-scoped state.

### Recommended pattern
Use `useState`/composables for shared state and pass request context explicitly where needed.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
SSR runs per request; module globals can leak state across requests.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: shared state in module scope and composable state factories.
- [ ] Minimal verification: request-specific data is not shared globally.
- [ ] Stop condition: solution depends on mutable globals without explicit isolation.

### Rule ID: `arch-server-entrypoint-for-sensitive-io`
### Rule: Keep sensitive I/O behind server entrypoints
### When to apply
Calling third-party APIs, databases, or internal services with credentials.

### Wrong pattern
Making direct browser fetches to privileged upstream services with forwarded sensitive headers.

### Recommended pattern
Expose a constrained `server/api/*` boundary and call it from client/UI code.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
`useFetch('/api/*')` on server uses request-aware fetch behavior; external APIs require explicit header allowlisting.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: upstream fetch targets, header forwarding, and token placement.
- [ ] Minimal verification: browser code only talks to safe internal endpoints.
- [ ] Stop condition: architecture requires direct client access to privileged credentials.

<!-- automd:file src="./rules/server-routes-runtime-config.md" -->

## Server Routes, h3 Patterns, and Runtime Config

### Rule ID: `server-validate-input-at-boundary`
### Rule: Validate request input at handler boundaries
### When to apply
Creating or updating `server/api/*` routes, webhook handlers, or actions.

### Wrong pattern
Trusting payload shape and casting request body directly.

### Recommended pattern
Validate input at handler entry and return explicit HTTP errors on invalid data.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Keep validation close to h3 handler entrypoints to avoid hidden assumptions.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: new/edited handler params, body parsing, query usage.
- [ ] Minimal verification: invalid payload returns explicit error status.
- [ ] Stop condition: handler cannot define a stable input contract.

### Rule ID: `server-runtime-config-public-minimal`
### Rule: Keep runtime config exposure intentional
### When to apply
Adding env vars or endpoint values in `runtimeConfig`.

### Wrong pattern
Moving broad server configuration into `runtimeConfig.public`.

### Recommended pattern
Expose only the minimum public keys required by the client.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Changes under `runtimeConfig.public` are effectively public API changes.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: `nuxt.config` runtime config additions/changes.
- [ ] Minimal verification: only intended public keys are exposed.
- [ ] Stop condition: feature requires exposing secrets in public config.

### Rule ID: `server-header-forwarding-allowlist`
### Rule: Forward request headers intentionally
### When to apply
Proxying request context from SSR to internal or external API calls.

### Wrong pattern
Blindly forwarding all inbound headers to upstream services.

### Recommended pattern
Use `useFetch('/api/*')` for internal request-context propagation and explicit allowlists for external API calls.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Relative `useFetch` calls on server use request-aware fetch behavior; external forwarding still requires explicit safety controls.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: forwarded header sets and upstream destination type (internal vs external).
- [ ] Minimal verification: only required headers are forwarded, with no unsafe pass-through.
- [ ] Stop condition: upstream contract demands full raw header pass-through.

<!-- /automd -->

<!-- automd:file src="./rules/nitro-h3-patterns.md" -->

## Nitro and h3 Server Patterns

### Rule ID: `nitro-validated-input-helpers`
### Rule: Use h3 validated helpers for route params, query, and body
### When to apply
Creating or refactoring `server/api/*` handlers with external input.

### Wrong pattern
Casting `event.context.params`, `getQuery(event)`, or `readBody(event)` to trusted shapes without validation.

### Recommended pattern
Use `getValidatedRouterParams`, `getValidatedQuery`, and `readValidatedBody` (for example with Zod parsers) at handler boundaries.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Nuxt server routes run on h3; validated helpers provide both runtime safety and stronger type flow than ad-hoc casting.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: all untrusted handler inputs (params/query/body).
- [ ] Minimal verification: invalid inputs return explicit client-safe errors.
- [ ] Stop condition: accepted schema/validator is not available in project constraints.

### Rule ID: `nitro-waituntil-for-nonblocking-work`
### Rule: Move non-critical async side work to `event.waitUntil`
### When to apply
Logging, cache warmup, or analytics in server handlers that should not delay response.

### Wrong pattern
Awaiting non-essential async jobs before sending response.

### Recommended pattern
Return response early and schedule non-critical work with `event.waitUntil(...)`.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
`event.waitUntil` integrates with runtime providers to finish background work after response, including edge-like runtimes.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: awaited tasks in request critical path.
- [ ] Minimal verification: response path no longer blocks on non-critical work.
- [ ] Stop condition: task result is required to compute response.

### Rule ID: `nitro-cache-varies-for-tenant-host`
### Rule: Configure `cache.varies` when caching depends on request headers
### When to apply
Using Nitro cache/route rules with host-aware or tenant-aware logic.

### Wrong pattern
Reading host-based request data under cached routes without declaring varying headers.

### Recommended pattern
Set `cache.varies` for headers that affect output (typically `host`, `x-forwarded-host` in multi-tenant setups).

### Nuxt-specific caveat
With cached responses, incoming request headers are dropped by default; `useRequestURL()` can otherwise resolve host as `localhost`.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: cached route logic that branches on headers/host.
- [ ] Minimal verification: cache keys vary by intended tenant headers.
- [ ] Stop condition: output is fully header-invariant.

### Rule ID: `nitro-api-error-shape-client-safe`
### Rule: Use client-safe API error shape in server handlers
### When to apply
Throwing errors from `server/api/*` endpoints consumed by clients.

### Wrong pattern
Throwing generic errors or relying on long/internal `message` values to reach clients.

### Recommended pattern
Throw `createError` with explicit `status` and short `statusText`; use `data` for structured client payload and keep sensitive detail server-side.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
In API routes, `statusText` is the safer client-facing channel; avoid embedding dynamic user input in messages.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: thrown API errors and exposed message payloads.
- [ ] Minimal verification: consistent status code/text contract with no sensitive leakage.
- [ ] Stop condition: upstream error contract cannot be mapped safely.

### Rule ID: `nitro-runtime-config-from-event`
### Rule: Prefer `useRuntimeConfig(event)` in server routes
### When to apply
Accessing runtime config inside server handlers.

### Wrong pattern
Reading config without event context in handlers that may depend on runtime overrides.

### Recommended pattern
Pass `event` to `useRuntimeConfig(event)` in server handlers.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Passing event is optional but recommended for runtime-overridden environment values in route execution.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: server handlers using runtime config.
- [ ] Minimal verification: handler config values resolve correctly in runtime deployment environment.
- [ ] Stop condition: execution context is not an h3 event handler.

<!-- automd:file src="./rules/plugins.md" -->

## Plugins and Runtime Boot

### Rule ID: `plugin-use-composables-before-plugin`
### Rule: Prefer composables/utilities before creating a plugin
### When to apply
Adding shared logic or helper functions used by limited parts of the app.

### Wrong pattern
Creating a global plugin for logic that can live in local composables/utilities.

### Recommended pattern
Use plugins only for true app-wide injection, app hooks, or framework integration boundaries.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Every plugin participates in startup/hydration paths; unnecessary plugins add global boot cost.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: plugin purpose, usage breadth, and required injection scope.
- [ ] Minimal verification: plugin is justified by app-wide behavior, not convenience alone.
- [ ] Stop condition: integration requires app-level hook/injection semantics.

### Rule ID: `plugin-async-parallel-when-independent`
### Rule: Run async plugins in parallel when they are independent
### When to apply
Multiple async plugins with no ordering dependency.

### Wrong pattern
Leaving independent async plugins serialized.

### Recommended pattern
Use object plugin syntax with `parallel: true`; define `dependsOn` only for real ordering constraints.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Nuxt plugin runtime supports parallel execution and dependency-aware sequencing.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: plugin async work and inter-plugin dependency graph.
- [ ] Minimal verification: independent plugins run in parallel without race conditions.
- [ ] Stop condition: plugin order is required for correctness.

### Rule ID: `plugin-order-controls-only-when-necessary`
### Rule: Use plugin ordering controls sparingly
### When to apply
You need deterministic plugin execution order.

### Wrong pattern
Using `order`/`enforce` aggressively to patch unclear plugin design.

### Recommended pattern
Keep default order first; use `dependsOn` for explicit dependency edges and reserve `order` for advanced edge cases.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
`order` overrides `enforce` and increases maintenance risk when plugin graphs evolve.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: plugin metadata (`enforce`, `dependsOn`, `order`) and real dependency needs.
- [ ] Minimal verification: ordering metadata is minimal and documented by dependency reason.
- [ ] Stop condition: required order cannot be represented without broad global ordering hacks.

<!-- automd:file src="./rules/performance-rendering.md" -->

## Performance and Rendering

### Rule ID: `perf-use-nuxtlink-for-internal-nav`
### Rule: Use `NuxtLink` for internal navigation
### When to apply
Creating or refactoring internal navigation links.

### Wrong pattern
Using raw `<a>` tags for internal routes without Nuxt link behavior.

### Recommended pattern
Use `NuxtLink` for internal routes and tune prefetch strategy when needed (`visible` vs `interaction`).

### Nuxt-specific caveat
`NuxtLink` carries built-in route-aware prefetching and defaults that reduce navigation latency.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: internal links in pages/layout/components.
- [ ] Minimal verification: internal links use `NuxtLink` and preserve semantics/accessibility.
- [ ] Stop condition: link target is external or deliberately bypasses router.

### Rule ID: `perf-match-route-rules-to-content-volatility`
### Rule: Use route rules to match rendering strategy to content volatility
### When to apply
Pages with mixed static, stale-while-revalidate, ISR, or client-only requirements.

### Wrong pattern
Applying one rendering mode globally when route behavior differs.

### Recommended pattern
Set explicit `routeRules` per route family (`prerender`, `swr`, `isr`, `ssr: false`) based on freshness and SEO needs.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Nuxt/Nitro route rules directly shape cache semantics and server behavior per route.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: route patterns, freshness requirements, and SEO constraints.
- [ ] Minimal verification: configured rules align with intended cache/render behavior.
- [ ] Stop condition: deployment target cannot support required route rule semantics.

### Rule ID: `perf-lazy-load-and-hydrate-intentionally`
### Rule: Use lazy component loading and lazy hydration intentionally
### When to apply
Components not required for first meaningful paint or immediate interactivity.

### Wrong pattern
Hydrating all components eagerly on initial page load.

### Recommended pattern
Use `Lazy*` component imports and hydration triggers (for example `hydrate-on-visible`) for non-critical islands.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Lazy hydration support exists in Nuxt and can materially reduce main-thread work on initial navigation.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: above-the-fold criticality and interactive timing needs.
- [ ] Minimal verification: non-critical UI defers code/hydration without breaking UX.
- [ ] Stop condition: component must be immediately interactive for first render flow.

### Rule ID: `perf-reduce-payload-and-asset-cost`
### Rule: Reduce payload and asset cost before adding infra complexity
### When to apply
Performance regressions tied to response size, client JS, images, or third-party scripts.

### Wrong pattern
Adding caching layers first while shipping oversized payloads/assets.

### Recommended pattern
Trim async-data payload shape, optimize images/fonts/scripts with Nuxt-native tooling, and profile with DevTools + `nuxi analyze`.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Nuxt Image, Nuxt Fonts, and Nuxt Scripts are designed to target LCP/CLS/INP regressions with Nuxt-aware defaults.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: payload tab, bundle analysis, image/script/font loading paths.
- [ ] Minimal verification: measurable reduction in transferred bytes or blocking work on critical path.
- [ ] Stop condition: bottleneck is backend latency unrelated to client payload/asset behavior.

## Module Authoring Conventions

### Rule ID: `module-keep-setup-fast-and-defer-heavy-work`
### Rule: Keep module setup fast and defer heavy work
### When to apply
Authoring or updating a Nuxt module with runtime behavior.

### Wrong pattern
Performing expensive async work directly in module `setup`.

### Recommended pattern
Keep `setup` lightweight and defer heavier tasks to lifecycle hooks or deferred build/runtime hooks.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Nuxt warns when module setup takes too long; slow setup delays dev server and build startup.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: `defineNuxtModule` setup body and async operations.
- [ ] Minimal verification: startup-critical path avoids long blocking work.
- [ ] Stop condition: required initialization must complete before app/module lifecycle proceeds.

### Rule ID: `module-prefix-public-exports`
### Rule: Prefix public exports and routes
### When to apply
Adding module composables, components, plugins, or server routes.

### Wrong pattern
Publishing generic names like `useData`, `<Button>`, or `/api/auth` from a module.

### Recommended pattern
Prefix public surface with module identity (`useFooData`, `<FooButton>`, `/api/_foo/*`).

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Unprefixed module routes/components collide easily with app code and other modules.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: names of components/composables/runtime API routes.
- [ ] Minimal verification: exported names are collision-resistant and module-scoped.
- [ ] Stop condition: backward compatibility policy requires legacy unprefixed aliases.

### Rule ID: `module-public-kit-apis-only`
### Rule: Prefer documented Nuxt Kit APIs over internals
### When to apply
Implementing Nuxt module behavior and code generation logic.

### Wrong pattern
Relying on private Nuxt internals or undocumented hooks.

### Recommended pattern
Use stable `@nuxt/kit` APIs, documented hooks, and declared compatibility constraints.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Private internals can break across minor/patch updates even when compatibility appears broad.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: imported kit functions/hooks and internal path imports.
- [ ] Minimal verification: implementation uses public Nuxt APIs with explicit compatibility.
- [ ] Stop condition: required behavior has no documented public API yet.

### Rule ID: `module-skill-scope-only`
### Rule: Scope module skills to module APIs only
### When to apply
Publishing `agents.skills` with a module.

### Wrong pattern
Embedding global Nuxt framework guidance inside module-specific skill docs.

### Recommended pattern
Document only module APIs, integration points, and module-specific caveats.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Module guidance can override Nuxt guidance only inside that module's explicit scope.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: skill frontmatter, rule language, examples.
- [ ] Minimal verification: instructions are module-scoped and version-aligned.
- [ ] Stop condition: module skill introduces global rules unrelated to module behavior.

## Migrations and Compatibility

### Rule ID: `migration-reversible-slices`
### Rule: Perform migrations in reversible slices
### When to apply
Nuxt, Nitro, h3, or module major/minor upgrades.

### Wrong pattern
Large unscoped migration commits with no rollback checkpoints.

### Recommended pattern
Split migration into small steps with explicit validation after each step.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Validate both SSR render path and client hydration path.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: changed APIs, config keys, and migration commit boundaries.
- [ ] Minimal verification: each slice can be reverted independently.
- [ ] Stop condition: migration cannot be tested incrementally.

### Rule ID: `migration-upgrade-touched-deprecations`
### Rule: Remove deprecated APIs in touched areas
### When to apply
Editing files already using deprecated Nuxt/Nitro/h3 patterns.

### Wrong pattern
Keeping mixed old/new patterns in the same touched code path.

### Recommended pattern
Upgrade touched deprecated usage while context is active.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Prefer official migration mappings over ad-hoc replacements.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: touched deprecated symbols and replacement mapping.
- [ ] Minimal verification: no deprecated usage remains in modified files.
- [ ] Stop condition: required replacement API is not yet stable in target version.

### Rule ID: `migration-verify-ssr-and-hydration`
### Rule: Verify both server render and hydration behavior after each slice
### When to apply
Any migration touching rendering, data fetching, plugins, or runtime config.

### Wrong pattern
Validating only build success without browser hydration and runtime checks.

### Recommended pattern
Validate SSR output, hydration warnings, critical data paths, and route navigation on each migration slice.

### Nuxt-specific caveat
Nuxt migrations can pass type checks while still regressing payload transfer or hydration behavior.

### Execution checklist
- [ ] Inputs to inspect: browser console hydration warnings, route transitions, and async-data behavior.
- [ ] Minimal verification: no hydration mismatch warnings and no duplicate initial fetch regressions.
- [ ] Stop condition: environment lacks a runnable app context for runtime verification.
